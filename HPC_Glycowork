Hi Philip,

Here are the steps to install it on SuperMIC:

Step 1:
# Run this command once and also add it to the .modules file
module load python/3.8.5-anaconda-ood

Step 2:
conda init bash

Step 3: Log out and back in

Step 4:
# This command starts an interactive session on a compute node since there is no GPU on the head node
qsub -I -l walltime=2:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=36 -q v100 -A <name of your allocation>

Step 5: run these commands:
conda create --name glycowork python=3.8
conda activate glycowork
pip install glycowork

At this point, you should be able to run "import glycowork"within a Python session. 

If the command line interface is a bit challenging and Jupyter Notebook is preferred, I can help make a custom kernel for the Open OnDemand portal. Please let me know.

Cheers,
Le
